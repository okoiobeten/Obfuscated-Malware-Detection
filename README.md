# Obfuscated Malware Detection

## Overview

This repository features the Obfuscated Malware dataset, curated by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. Obfuscated malware, designed to hide and evade detection, poses challenges for cybersecurity professionals. The dataset, named `Obfuscated-MalMem2022.csv`, serves as a valuable resource for testing obfuscated malware detection methods, particularly focusing on memory-based techniques.

## Dataset Description

- **File:** `Obfuscated-MalMem2022.csv`
- **Content:** The dataset comprises obfuscated malware instances, including Spyware, Ransomware, and Trojan Horse malware. It is carefully crafted to represent real-world scenarios, offering a balanced set of examples for testing obfuscated malware detection systems.

## Usage Instructions

### Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

1. Open `updatedmalware.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute the cells in the notebook to analyze and develop obfuscated malware detection methods.

### Spyder IDE with Streamlit

1. Ensure that Streamlit is installed. If not, use the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```

2. Open Spyder IDE.

3. Run the `app_streamlit.py` script using the following command in the Spyder console:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app_streamlit.py
    ```

This command will initiate the Streamlit application for obfuscated malware detection, providing an interactive interface for users to explore and evaluate detection methods.

Feel free to contribute to the enhancement of obfuscated malware detection techniques using this dataset.

## Note

Ensure all dependencies are installed, and the appropriate Python environment is set up before running the code.

Happy analyzing and detecting!
